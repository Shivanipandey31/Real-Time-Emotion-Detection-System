# Real-Time Emotion Detection System 😃😢😠

This is a Flask-based web application that performs **real-time facial emotion detection** using a model trained on the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013). The system uses OpenCV to capture video frames and a trained deep learning model to predict emotions.

## 🔧 Features

- Real-time webcam-based emotion recognition
- Emotions displayed live on the frontend
- Trained model integrated with Flask backend

## 🧠 Model Training

The model was trained on the FER-2013 dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).
The model was trained using **TensorFlow/Keras** on the **FER-2013 dataset**.
